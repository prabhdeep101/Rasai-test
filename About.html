                <h2>What is Rasai?</h2>
                <p class="p1"><span class="green">Rasai</span> In Sinhalese means “tasty.” It reflects the authenticity,
                     the richness, and the vibrancy of Sri Lanka’s diverse culinary traditions. Complex and vibrant,
                      Sri Lankan cuisine is well known for its combination of herbs and spices and is centred around 
                      many varieties of rice.<br><br>
                      Coconut milk, oil and pulp also play a significant role in the cuisine, 
                      as is preserved fish. A hub in the historical oceanic Silk Road, contact with foreign traders 
                      brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country’s 
                      ethnic groups, all of which have helped shaped the cuisine of Sri Lanka..</p>

        <p class="p2">I have a passion for preparing authentic and tradition Sri Lankan meals, 
            through trialling different combination of spices to bring out the best flavours of meat, 
            seafood and vegetables. I am inspired to share my Sri Lankan heritage and culture through 
            authentic dishes from my homeland.</p>

            <h2 class="abouthead">About Me</h2>
            <p class="Aboutme">My name is Dhammika, and I was born in Colombo, 
                Sri Lanka, and having lived in Papua New Guinea for most of my schooling years, 
                I migrated to New Zealand in 1999.<br><br>
                 I grew up where food was the centre of almost everything, 
                from family gathering to special occasions. Yearly celebrations such as the Sinhala and Tamil 
                New Year and Christmas means the preparation of authentic cuisine – that reflects the Sri Lankan 
                tradition and made with intention and care.<br><br>
                The passion to share the authentic cuisine of Sri Lanka has 
                inspired me to open the doors to Rasai.<br><br>
                I welcome you to my table!</p>
